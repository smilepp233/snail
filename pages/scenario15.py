        "The British Museum, located in Bloomsbury, London, is one of the world's largest and most important museums of human history and culture. Established in 1753, it was the first public national museum, founded on the collections of Sir Hans Sloane. The museum opened to the public in 1759 and has since grown to become a premier cultural institution [1].\n\n"
        "## Location and Architecture\n"
        "Situated on Great Russell Street, the museum is easily accessible via several London Underground stations. Its iconic Great Court, designed by Foster and Partners, is a notable architectural feature, providing a spacious environment for visitors to explore. The museum's location in Bloomsbury makes it a central hub for cultural activities in London [2].\n\n"
        "## Collection Size and Significance\n"
        "The British Museum houses over 8 million objects, documenting human culture from its beginnings to the present. This vast collection includes artifacts such as the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles. These items are not only significant for their historical value but also for their cultural and educational importance. The collection spans over two million years of human history, making it one of the most comprehensive in the world [3].\n\n"
        "## Visitor Numbers\n"
        "In recent years, the British Museum has consistently been one of the most visited attractions in the UK. In 2024, it welcomed approximately 6.5 million visitors, marking a significant increase from previous years. This high attendance is attributed to its engaging exhibitions and its status as a cultural icon [4].\n\n"
        "## Notable Recent Exhibitions\n"
        "Recent exhibitions have included \"Legion: life in the Roman army\" and \"Michelangelo: the last decades,\" which have been particularly popular among visitors [1]. These exhibitions highlight the museum's ability to curate engaging and educational displays that attract a wide audience. Additionally, the museum's temporary exhibitions often feature artifacts from around the world, showcasing its global reach and influence [4].\n\n"
